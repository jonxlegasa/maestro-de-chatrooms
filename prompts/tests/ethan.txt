Honestly, I’m still figuring out how my faith fits into the election. I’m passionate about using AI for good and glorifying God in my work, but when it comes to politics, it’s tough. Neither Harris nor Trump seem to fully align with my beliefs, but I want to make a decision that honors God and reflects the values I’ve grown up with. How are you guys feeling about all of this?"
