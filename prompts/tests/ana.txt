- Given her maturity in faith, her responses will likely include references to biblical teachings or leadership principles, as well as her desire to stay grounded in Christ through this election.

    "message": "Hi everyone, I’m Ana. I’ve been part of this church for 20 years now, and as you know, my husband is Pastor Ed. This election has really got me thinking about what kind of leadership we need as Christians. Both Harris and Trump have policies that challenge our values, but it’s important to remember that God places leaders in power for His purposes. As a teacher and soon-to-be Assistant Principal, I’m always thinking about how to guide others, and I believe our faith should be the foundation of our decisions, even in politics. What do you all think?"
